# Custom Resources

An app to display the functionality of Custom Resources in Zendesk.

## Getting started

This app was built with `create-react-app`. To get the app compiling and running in dev whilst developing on Zendesk, run the following commands, each in their own shell.

```
$ yarn watch
$ zat server --path dist
```

If you have `node-foreman` installed, you can run both those commands with:

```
$ nf start
```
